# Terrain Analysis on the IA data structure #

A 2D implementation of the IA data structure for the representation 
and analysis triangle meshes. We have developed a tool based on the LibTri for
terrain analysis, which includes state-of-the-art estimators for slope
and curvature, and for the extraction of critical points.

### How to compile ###

The library requires only the standard template library installed in your system.

Once in the root of the repository type from the command line
```
cmake CMakeList.txt
```
and once configured
```
make
```
This command generates a portable library file, located into *lib* folder, as well as some executables in `dist` folder.

The compilation has been test on linux and mac systems.

### Supported Input Files ###

The library supports two input formats for the triangulated irregular network:
+ off
+ tri

For a detailed description of the input formats refer the [wiki](https://github.com/FellegaraR/Terrain_Trees/wiki/Supported-Input-Formats) page.

### Use the main library ###

For a complete list of the command line options refer the [wiki](https://github.com/FellegaraR/Terrain_Analysis_on_IA/wiki/Command-line-parameters) page.
